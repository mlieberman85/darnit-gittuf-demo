# Verifying Releases

## Release Signature Verification

All releases are signed to verify author identity and integrity.

### Verify with GitHub

GitHub releases show a "Verified" badge when the release was created
by an authorized repository collaborator.

### Verify with Git Tags

Signed tags can be verified using:

```bash
git tag -v <tag-name>
```

### Verify with Sigstore (if applicable)

If releases are signed with Sigstore:

```bash
cosign verify-blob --bundle <release>.bundle <release-artifact>
```
